# ml-certification
These are the projects I completed during my certification in machine learning last summer, and the specific functions I had to complete.

Week 2: Linear and Multivariate Linear Regression

Week 3: Logistic Regression

Week 4: One vs. All Logistic Regression and Neural Networks
  - Cost function for logistic regression
  - Training a one-vs-all multi-class classifier
  - Creating predictions using the one-vs-all classifier
  - Neural network prediction function

Week 5: Neural Network Learning (Backpropagation)
  - Computing the gradient of the sigmoid function
  - Randomly initializing the weights of each connection
  - Calculating the cost function of the neural network
